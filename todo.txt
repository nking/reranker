-- add metrics
-- add the save so can download and persist it with project
-- edit to use device parameter instead of hard coded 'cpu'
   for ability to use with kaggle GPU, collab TPU, etc.
-- make repository public
-- create a kaggle notebook
   and edit it to import the code and run it.
-- when finished,
   - download model and store it in repository for now depending upon size
   - hard code the working versions of libraries to install
     so the notebook will be future proof to all
     except python dependency
   - add all the notes and references about the model
