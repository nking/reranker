-- update pyproject and setup for dependencies
   - consider a requirements.txt file too
-- make repository public
-- create a kaggle notebook
   and edit it to import the code and run it.
-- when finished,
   - download model and store it in repository for now depending upon size
   - hard code the working versions of libraries to install
     so the notebook will be future proof to all
     except python dependency
   - add all the notes and references about the model
